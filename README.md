# Hotel-Bookings-Modelling
This project was initially developed as the final assessment for the Maths in AI and Data Science course run by ASMP. I have since independently expanded and refactored the code, adding additional analysis, features, and improvements beyond the original specification. The dataset used comes from Kaggle.
